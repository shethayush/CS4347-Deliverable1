We chose to develop WeFiT because, as college students, we know how difficult it is to have to balance academics and a healthy lifestyle simultaneously. We understand that there are various fitness apps focusing on specific features, but we wanted to create a complete system that can track workouts, nutrition, and progress toward personal goals! We expect our users to be be people who are struggling in organizing and implementing fitness into their daily lives. This solution solves a real-world problem of worsening health conditions worldwide, which can be pinpointed down to lack of fitness and proper nutrition. By honing down on this issue, we hope to change this!
